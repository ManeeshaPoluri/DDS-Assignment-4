CSE-512 Distributed Database Systems – Assignment 4			


Main: Main invokes mapper and reducer classes.

Mapper: Mapper class takes the input from table1 and table2. Creates a key-value pair where key is primary key and value is the tuple generated.

Reducer: Reducer class takes the key-value pairs generated by mapper class, processes tuples as batches i.e., Batch-A, batch-B. Now it looks for joining column in 2 tables and creates a new tuple in output table for each matching column


Assignment is run using command:

sudo -u <username> <path_of_hadoop> jar <name_of_jar> <class_with_main_function> <HDFSinputFile> <HDFSoutputFile>
 
<path_of_hadoop> –> Hadoop Path
<name_of_jar> –> equijoin.jar
<class_with_main_function> –> equijoin
<HDFSinputFile> –> HDFS location of Input file
<HDFSoutputFile> –> HDFS location of Output file
Output is generated at Hadoop localhost: hdfs://localhost:54310/output
